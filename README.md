Fix for an addon made by AlexAFWS https://twitter.com/FuckThisShit747

Addon from original Tweet https://twitter.com/FuckThisShit747/status/1193997187975438338

Fixes:
Removed redundant/ two definitions of the register() function, which is what caused some problems of registering functions, such as "sampleTextPreferences" when reinstalling the addon in Blender. 

Thanks for the Addon btw!
